# 1438 RBA Mod

## Acknowledgements

Developed by pimittens.

## Installation

- Replace the mod DLL of the same name in `katamari_Data/Managed` in your game folder.
- You can replace the modded DLL with the original DLL to return to the unmodded game. The original DLL can be reacquired from Steam if you lose track of it.

## Description

In the original game, the six constellation levels that track themed objects
(e.g. Make Cancer, which tracks crabs) do not save your collection progress if you quit out
of the level early, even if you've met the invisible goal of the stage. The only way to save
collection progress is to wait out the duration of the level timer (a total of 51 minutes for all six levels)
while also meeting the invisible goal.

To make matters worse, each of these levels has a cousin which only appears after the level has been
completed once, so to collect these cousins (and hence, all objects) requires a total of **102 minutes** of
"autoscroller" gameplay, where the skill ceiling is significantly lower than normal Katamari speedrunning.

This mod remedies this problem by **allowing early exits from these six constellation levels**,
provided that the original invisible goals of the constellation are met. These goals are:

  - Make Cancer: 10 crabs
  - Make Cygnus: 30 swans
  - Make Pisces: 60 fish
  - Make Corona Borealis: 20 crowns
  - Make Virgo: 80 maidens
  - Make Gemini: 22 sets of twins

This mod is legal for use in the speedrun.com "1438 objects (RBA Mod)" category.
**It is not legal in the unmodded 1438 objects category.**
