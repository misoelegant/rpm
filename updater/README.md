# Reroll Mod Updater

## Setup (please read this)

- Before running the updater, use Steam to revert to the
  unmodded game files
  (right click the game in your Steam library -> properties -> "local
  files" tab -> "verify integrity of game files").
  **You only have to revert files once, and the updater can be used to
  return to the original game after that**.

- Download `RPMUpdater.exe` and **place it in the root game directory**.
  This is the same directory as the game executable, `katamari.exe`.
  (To open the root game directory, from the same "local files" tab,
  select "browse local files").

- You should now be able to run `RPMUpdater.exe` to download and install
  the available mods.

## Changelog
