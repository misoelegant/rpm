# Reroll Mod Updater

## Setup (please read this)

- Before running the updater, use Steam to revert to the
  unmodded game files to revert to the unmodded game
  (right click the game in your Steam library -> properties -> "local
  files" tab -> "verify integrity of game files").

- Download `RPMUpdater.exe` and **place it in the root game directory**.
  This is the same directory as the game executable, `katamari.exe`.
  (To open the root game directory, from the same "local files" tab,
  select "browse local files").
