# Reroll Mod Updater

## Setup

- Use Steam to revert to the unmodded game:
  - Right click the game in your Steam library -> Properties
  - In the "Local Files" tab, select "Verify integrity of game files".

- In the same "Local Files" tab, select "Browse..." to open
  the Steam game directory.

- Download `RPMUpdater.exe` and move it to the Steam game directory
  that you just opened.

- You should now be able to run `RPMUpdater.exe` to download and install
  the available mods.
  - **Note:** "installing" a version of Reroll means that's the version that
    plays when you open the game. You can use this to easily switch between
    the practice mod and the original game for RTA.

## Changelog

- Fixed a goofy bug that caused the practice mod to be listed as
  an "unknown" version.
